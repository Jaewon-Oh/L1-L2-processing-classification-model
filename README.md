# L1-L2-processing-classification-model
This repository contains python scripts used in my bachelor's thesis, 'Machine Learning Model that Classifies L1/L2 Processing Using EEG Data'.
Support vector machine and random forest were used as classifiers.
Epochs : 300-500ms and 600-1000ms post-stimulus
Condition sets : WP-WI (Whole Plausible - Whole Implausible), EP-EI (Experimental Plausible - Experimental Implausible), CP-CI (Control Plausible - Control Implausible), Whole, Plausible, Implausible
Data were provided (in part) by the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour.(https://data.donders.ru.nl/) EEG data used in the preparation of this study came from DOI https://doi.org/10.34973/etwm-3r51.
