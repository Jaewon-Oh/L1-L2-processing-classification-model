This is the python script I used for SVM and RF training and testing for L1/L2 processing classification.
If you open the Colab link and run the code, please bring input data from the 'Input Data' folder in this repository.
Be careful on the filename because if you put a wrong file, you will get an error.
You can see the correct name of file from the first line of the third code cell in the Colab link.
Thank you:)
